          his first performance,the public was immediatly conquered by the juggle impressive mastery of the 3 langages; the famous &#60;div&#62; thrower; and of course the irressistible sense of humour of java and javascript the false twins clown .<br />Completely
                  virtual but virtually ubiquitous, the wild circus Continues is travel all around the digital world. For the guiness book, very soon the Wild circus could pretend to have the world's most web site debut and this of course because of the many
          pretenders to the Wildschool ;-).<br />Wild circus The greatest worldwilde circus ever !!!</p>
